Our contribution is the design of a general purpose method to enable anyone to publish, discover, fetch, test and triage declarative information about normative rules which are ‘in effect’ for given dates/times, identities and jurisdictions, and that are ‘applicable’ when certain facts exhibit. When normative rules can be discovered and transmitted on-demand in response to specified events or status changes, many types of operations become greatly simplified, and each party’s control of their data is strengthened. This approach to ‘oughtomation’ reflects core virtues of the Internet. Some are summarized below, and more detail is in the white paper.",
