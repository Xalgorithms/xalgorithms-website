            h3.title Xalgorithms Foundation
            p.projwords From its inception five years ago, Xalgorithms has been 100% developer-resourced. Team members came together organically to create the oughtomation method, each committing effort and funds based upon a shared perception of this meso-level problem, a kernel of understanding about how to solve it, and an instinct to make this free/libre/open. Our plan for 2020-2025 builds upon this tradition. We invite other developer-oriented free/libre/open initiatives to contribute effort and funds to help advance the oughtomation specification, the reference implementation, service deployment, and to support the use-case working groups.
