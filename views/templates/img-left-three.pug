            h3.title Xalgorithms Foundation
            p.projwords From its inception five years ago, Xalgorithms has been 100% developer-resourced. Team members came together organically to create the oughtomation method, each committing effort and funds based upon a shared perception of this meso-level problem, a kernel of understanding about how to solve it, and an instinct to make this free/libre/open. Our plan for 2020-2025 builds upon this tradition. We invite other developer-oriented free/libre/open initiatives to contribute effort and funds to help advance the oughtomation specification, the reference implementation, and service deployment. We invite commercial, government, scientific, and civil society collaboration and support for particular use-case working groups. Please feel free to contact Joseph Potvin, Executive Director
