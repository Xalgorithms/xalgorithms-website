      h3.title Smart Edges, Simple Core
      p.projwords Data control and processing complexity belong at the edges of the Internet, on the computers of individuals, organizations, and their chosen speciality service providers. Data control includes choice in data routing. Two or more parties may prefer to communicate on the Internet solely via routers that implement particular neutrality, privacy or other normative rule sets. Programmable routers and data-plane functionality across future networks will require a general-purpose method to give effect to MUST, MAY and SHOULD asserted at the edge.

      h3.title Uncoupled Networks
      p.projwords Loose coupling of components and data means interchangeable alternative implementations, to avoid misplaced restrictions relating to platform, programming language, operating system or supplier, which  clash with edge-based prerogative.  The oughtomation method implements “rules-as-data” with simple input/output control-tables that work with any programming language, given the accompanying parsing library. This avoids “rules as code” lock-in where algorithms are expressed in various incompatible procedural programming languages.

      h3.title User Freedom <br>
      p.projwords The use of computer programs enable the extension of the user’s intellectual and tangible faculty of action: their agency. This is a ‘demand-side’ concern. When a society is premised upon consent, every user retains freedom of agency to run software for any purpose, to not run it, to study how the program works, to adapt it to specific needs, to copy the program and to redistribute copies, to improve the program, and to release any modified versions.

      h3.title Open Source Construction
      p.projwords LComputer programs enable the extension of the programmer’s intellectual and tangible faculty of action: their agency. This is a ‘supply-side’ concern. The market value proposition for open source methods is that coopetition enables participating individuals and organizations to significantly augment benefits, better manage risk, and reduce costs through collaborative provisioning, learning, transparency, innovation and interoperability.
